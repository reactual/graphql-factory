        p
          | GraphQL Factory is a toolkit for composing GraphQL APIs. The main feature of factory is the ability to
          | define types and schemas using plain JavaScript objects (JSON format), but there are also other features like
          | plugin extensibility, definition shortcuts, and resolver middleware that are available.
        p
          | Before using GraphQL Factory it is
          | important that you become comfortable with the GraphQL specification.
